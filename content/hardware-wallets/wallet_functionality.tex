\section{The Ideal Functionality}\label{sec:fwallet}

$\Fw$ (Figures~\ref{fig:FWallet-1} and~\ref{fig:FWallet-2}) incorporates
$\Fsig$ and runs in the $\Gledg$-setting, interacting with the adversary
$\adversary$, a set of parties $\partyset$, and the environment $\env$. It
keeps the following, initially empty, items:
\begin{inparaenum}[i)]
    \item $A_{[]}$: a list of lists, each containing addresses and their corresponding public keys, $(\addr, \pubkey)$;
    \item $B_{[]}$: a list of lists, each containing addresses and their corresponding balance, $(\addr, \asset)$;
    \item $K_{[]}$: a list of master keys $\masterkeypair$.
\end{inparaenum}
$\Fw$ realizes the following operations, with all messages containing a session
id of the form $\sid = (\partyset, \sid')$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Wallet setup}: Upon a setup request, it initializes the list
        of addresses, generates the account's master key, registers to
        $\Gledg$, and returns the master private key to the user.
    \item \emph{Client Corruption}: When $\adversary$ corrupts a client
        $\client$, $\Fw$ leaks the public keys and addresses to which $\client$
        has access.
    \item \emph{Client session initialization}: To start a new session, $\Fw$
        computes and sends to $\client$, defined in $\sid'$, an assigned pass
        phrase; in the real world, the pass phrase acts as the authentication
        mechanism between the parties.
     \item \emph{Address generation}: $\Fw$ requests a new public key from
         $\Fsig$ and picks at random an address, with which to associate the
         key; it then stores the new address in the corresponding list and
         returns it to $\env$. If the client is corrupted, the functionality
         leaks the address and public key to $\adversary$.
    \item \emph{Balance calculation}: If $\client$ is honest, it queries the
        ledger to retrieve the blockchain; if the connected client is
        corrupted, it requests a chain from $\adversary$. Then, it calculates
        the wallet's available assets, based on the provided chain, and returns
        it to $\env$.
    \item \emph{Transaction issuing}: Upon receiving a transaction request, if
        $\client$ is corrupted, $\Fw$ leaks the transaction information to the
        adversary, which responds with a new transaction object. If $\user$ is
        also corrupted, $\Fw$ discards the original request and keeps the
        adversarial transaction, otherwise it ignores the adversary's response.
        Finally, $\Fw$ requests a signature from $\Fsig$ for the accepted
        transaction, which it then sends to $\Gledg$.
\end{itemize}

\myhalfbox{Functionality $\Fw$}{white!40}{white!10}{
    \noindent\emph{Setup:}
        Upon receiving $\msg{Setup}{}$ from some party $\user \in \partyset$,
        forward it to $\adversary$. Then add the empty list $A_{\user}$ to
        $A_{[]}$, register with $\Gledg$, pick the master key pair
        $(\masterprivkey_{\user}, \masterpubkey_{\user}) \xleftarrow{\$}
        \keyset$ and add it to $K_{[]}$ and return $\msg{SetupOK}{}$ to
        $\user$.

    \noindent\emph{Client Corruption:}
        When $\adversary$ corrupts $\client$, send to $\adversary$
        $\msg{AddressList}{A_{\user}}$ and
        $\msg{MasterPubKey}{\masterpubkey_{\user}}$, for every $\user$ such
        that a \emph{Setup} session with $\client$ has been completed.

    \noindent\emph{Initialize Client Session:}
        Upon receiving $\msg{InitSession}{}$ from $\user$, pick $\clId
        \xleftarrow{\$} \{0, 1\}^\secparam$ and send $\msg{InitSession}{\clId}$
        to $\client$. If $\client$ is corrupted, send
        $\msg{InitSession}{\clId}$ to $\adversary$ and wait for a response
        $\msg{InitSessionOK}{\clId}$. Finally, send $\msg{Session}{\clId}$ to
        $\user$.

    \noindent\emph{Generate Address:}
        Upon receiving $\msg{GenAddr}{}$ from $\user$, send $\msg{KeyGen}{}$ to
        $\Fsig$ and wait for a response $\msg{Verification Key}{\pubkey}$.
        Then pick $\addr \xleftarrow{\$} \{0, 1\}^\addrlen$ and add $(\addr,
        \pubkey)$ to $A_{\user}$. If $\client$ is corrupted, send
        $\msg{Address}{(\addr, \pubkey)}$ to $\adversary$ and wait for a
        response $\msg{AddressOK}{\addr'}$. If $\user$ is corrupted, set $a =
        \addr'$, else set $a = \addr$; finally, return $\msg{Address}{a}$ to
        $\user$.

    \noindent\emph{Calculate Balance:}
        Upon receiving $\msg{GetBalance}{}$ from $\user$, send $\msg{Read}{}$
        to $\Gledg$ and wait for a response $\msg{Read}{\chain}$. If
        $\client$ is corrupted, send $\msg{Read}{}$ to $\adversary$ and, upon
        receiving the response $\msg{Read}{\chain'}$, set $\chain = \chain'$.
        Then initialize the list $B_{\user} \in B_{[]}$ with $(a, 0)$ for every
        address $(a, \cdot)$ in $A_{\user}$, and $\forall \tx \in \chain$, \ie
        the ordered transactions in the ledger \st $\tx = (\addr_s, \addr_r,
        \asset_\msf{pay}, \addr_c, \asset_\msf{change})$, do:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $\exists (\addr_s, \cdot) \in A_{\user}$, update the entry
                $(\addr_s, \asset_\msf{past})$ $\in$ $B_{\user}$ to $(\addr_s,
                0)$;
            \item If $\exists (\addr_r, \cdot) \in A_{\user}$, update the entry
                $(\addr_r, \asset_\msf{past})$ $\in$ $B_{\user}$ to $(\addr_r,
                \asset_\msf{past} + \asset_\msf{pay})$;
            \item If $\exists (\addr_c, \cdot) \in A_{\user}$, update the entry
                $(\addr_c, \asset_\msf{past})$ $\in$ $B_{\user}$ to $(\addr_c,
                \asset_\msf{past} + \asset_\msf{change})$;
        \end{itemize}
        Finally, compute $b = \sum_{(\cdot, \asset) \in B_{\user}} \asset$ and
        send $\msg{Balance}{b}$ to $\user$.

    \noindent\emph{Issue Transaction:}
        Upon receiving $\msg{IssueTX}{(\addr_r, \asset_\msf{pay},
        \asset_\msf{fee})}$ from $\user$, if $\client$ is corrupted,
        forward the message to $\adversary$ and wait for a response
        $\msg{IssueTx}{\clId, (\addr_r', \asset_\msf{pay}',
        \asset_\msf{fee}')}$. If $\user$ is corrupted, set
        $(\addr_r, \asset_\msf{pay}, \asset_\msf{fee}) =
        (\addr_r', \asset_\msf{pay}', \asset_\msf{fee}')$. Then,
        find $(\addr_{in}, \asset_{in}) \in B_{\user}: \asset_{in} \geq
        \asset_\msf{pay} + \asset_\msf{fee}$. If such entry exists,
        do the following:
        \begin{inparaenum}[i)]
            \item compute an address $\addr_c$ and its public key $\pubkey_c$,
                as per the \emph{Generate Address} interface;
            \item set $\asset_\msf{change} = \asset_{in} - \asset_\msf{pay} - \asset_\msf{fee}$
                and $\tx = (\addr_{in}, \addr_{out}, \asset_\msf{pay}, \addr_c, \asset_\msf{change})$;
            \item send $\msg{Sign}{\tx}$ to $\Fsig$ and wait for
                $\msg{Signature}{\tx, \sig}$;
            \item find $(\addr_{in}, \pubkey) \in A_{\user}$ and set
                $\tx_{\sig} = (\tx, \pubkey, \sig)$.
        \end{inparaenum}
        Then, if $\client$ is corrupted, send $\msg{Address}{\addr_c,
        \pubkey_c}$ and $\msg{Submit}{\tx_{\sig}}$ to $\adversary$ and wait for
        the response $\msg{SubmitOK}{}$. Finally, send
        $\msg{Submit}{\tx_{\sig}}$ to $\Gledg$.
