\section{Block-Proportional Rewards}\label{sec:proportional}

The arguably most common type of rewards in blockchain systems is
\emph{block-proportional} rewards. Specifically, each party is rewarded
proportionally to the number of blocks that it contributes to the final chain,
which is output at the end of the execution.

Block-proportional rewards are a generalization of the \emph{proportional allocation
rule}, which, for example, is employed in Bitcoin. The proportional allocation rule
states that a party $\party$'s \emph{expected} rewards of a single block are $\miningpower_{\party}$.
As shown by Chen \etal~\cite{chen2019axiomatic}, this
is the unique allocation rule that satisfies a list of desirable properties,
namely:
\begin{inparaenum}[i)]
    \item non-negativity,
    \item budget-balance,
    \item symmetry,
    \item sybil-proofness, and
    \item collusion-proofness.
\end{inparaenum}

Our work expands the scope by considering proportional rewards \wrt blocks for
the entirety of the execution. Specifically,
Definition~\ref{def:proportional-rewards} describes block-proportional rewards, where
a party $\party$'s rewards are \emph{strictly monotonically increasing} on the number of blocks that $\party$
contributes to the chain output by the observer $\observer$. The definition considers a \emph{proportional reward function} $\proportionalRewardFunc(\cdot,\cdot)$ that takes as input the chain of $\observer$ and $\party$ and outputs a value in $[0,1]$.


\begin{definition}[Block-Proportional Rewards]\label{def:proportional-rewards}
    For an execution trace $\executionTrace$, let $\chain_{\observer,\executionTrace}$ be the chain output by $\observer$ and
    $\totalReward_{\observer,\executionTrace} \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ be the
    total number of rewards which are distributed by the protocol, according to
    $\observer$. Let $\msgOutputSet_{\party,\executionTrace}$ be the number of
blocks in the chain output by $\observer$ which are produced by $\party$. A \emph{block-proportional reward} random variable $\reward_{\party, \execution}$ satisfies the
    following conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\forall \executionTrace \; \forall \party \in \partySet: \reward_{\party, \executionTrace} = \proportionalRewardFunc(\chain_{\observer,\executionTrace}, \party) \cdot \totalReward_{\observer,\executionTrace}$
        \item $\forall \executionTrace: \sum_{\party \in \partySet} \proportionalRewardFunc(\chain_{\observer,\executionTrace}, \party) = 1$
        \item $\forall \executionTrace \; \forall \party, \party' \in \partySet:\msgOutputSet_{\party,\executionTrace}>\msgOutputSet_{\party',\executionTrace}\Rightarrow \proportionalRewardFunc(\chain_{\observer,\executionTrace}, \party) > \proportionalRewardFunc(\chain_{\observer,\executionTrace}, \party')$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
