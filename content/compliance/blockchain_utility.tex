\subsection{Utility: Rewards and Costs}\label{sec:blockchain-utility}

For each execution, the blockchain protocol defines a number of total rewards,
which are distributed among the participating parties. For each party $\party$,
these rewards are expressed via the \emph{reward random variable}
$\reward_{\party, \execution}$.  For a specific trace $\executionTrace$, the
random variable takes a non-negative real value, denoted by $\reward_{\party,
\executionTrace}$. Intuitively, $\reward_{\party, \executionTrace}$ describes
the rewards that $\party$ receives from the protocol from the point of view of
the observer $\observer$, \ie \wrt the blocks accepted by
$\observer$.

Our analysis restricts to systems where rewards are distributed to parties if
and only if the genesis block is extended by at least one block during the
execution, in which case at least one party receives a non-negative amount of
rewards (Assumption~\ref{ass:reward-distribution}).

\begin{assumption}\label{ass:reward-distribution}
    Let $\executionTrace$ be an execution trace. If no block is produced during $\executionTrace$, then it
    holds that $\forall \party \in \partySet: \reward_{\party, \executionTrace} =
    0$.
    If at least one block is produced during $\executionTrace$, then it
    holds that $\exists \party \in \partySet: \reward_{\party, \executionTrace} \neq
    0$.
\end{assumption}

In addition to rewards, a party's utility is affected by cost. Specifically,
the \emph{cost random variable} $\cost_{\party, \execution}$ expresses the
operational cost that $\party$ during an execution $\execution$. For a fixed
trace $\executionTrace$, $\cost_{\party, \executionTrace}$ is a non-negative
real value. Our analysis is restricted to cost schemes which are \emph{linearly
monotonically increasing} in the number of queries that a party makes to the
oracle $\oracle_\proto$, with no queries incurring zero cost
(Assumption~\ref{ass:zero-cost}). Intuitively, this assumption considers the
electricity cost of participation, while the cost of equipment and other
operations, such as parsing or publishing messages, is zero.

\begin{assumption}\label{ass:zero-cost}
    For every execution trace $\executionTrace$, a party $\party$'s cost is
    $\cost_{\party, \executionTrace} = 0$ if and only if it performs no queries
    to $\oracle_\proto$ in every time slot. Else, if during $\executionTrace$ a party $\party$ performs
    $t$ queries, then its cost is $\cost_{\party, \executionTrace} = t \cdot \queryCost$, for some fixed parameter $\queryCost$.
\end{assumption}

Next, we define two types of utility. The first type, \emph{Reward}, considers
the expected rewards that a party receives when the cost is near $0$, while the
second type, \emph{Profit}, considers rewards minus participation cost.

\begin{definition}\label{def:utility}
    Let $\profile$ be a strategy profile and $\execution_\profile$ be an
    execution during which parties follow $\profile$. We define two types of
    blockchain utility $\utility_{\party}$ of a party $\party$ for $\profile$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Reward}: $\utility_{\party}(\profile) = E[\reward_{\party, \execution_\profile}]$
        \item \emph{Profit}: $\utility_{\party}(\profile) = E[\reward_{\party, \execution_\profile}] - E[\cost_{\party, \execution_\profile}]$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

For the computation of $\utility_{\party}$, the
environment $\env$ is fixed, while the
expectation of the random variables $\reward_{\party, \execution_\profile}$
and $\cost_{\party, \execution_\profile}$ is computed over the random coins of $\env$, $\oracle_\proto$, and every party $\party \in \partySet$.\smallskip

In the following sections, we evaluate the compliance of various Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
blockchain protocols \wrt two types of rewards, \emph{fair} and
\emph{block-proportional}.
