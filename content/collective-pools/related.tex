\paragraph{Related Work}
In cryptographic literature, pools are mostly treated from an engineering
perspective. In PoW systems, SmartPool~\cite{USENIX:LVTS17} is a notable design
of a distributed mining pool for Ethereum, which, similar to our work, utilizes
smart contracts for reward distribution.  On the PoS domain,
Ouroboros~\cite{C:KRDO17} offers a brief description of how delegation can be
used within the protocol. This idea is expanded in~\cite{SCN:KarKiaLar20},
which provides a formal definition of PoS wallets and includes stake pool
formation method via certificates. However, the pool's management is again
centralized around the operator; our work extends this line of work by enabling
the formation of a collective pool. Another work, orthogonal to ours, by
Br{\"{u}}njes \etal~\cite{DBLP:conf/eurosp/BrunjesKKS20} considers the
incentives of distributing rewards among stake pools and aims to incentivize
the creation of a (pre-defined) number of pools. However, it assumes that the
pool operator commits part of their stake to make the pool more appealing, thus
favoring larger pool operators. Our work eases such wealth concentration
tendencies by enabling a collective pool to be equally competitive to a
centralized one.
