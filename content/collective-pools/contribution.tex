\paragraph{Contributions}
The core contribution of this chapter is the ideal functionality $\Fpool$, a
simulation-based security definition of collective stake pools, which captures
the security properties of our collective pool scheme. We then describe
$\Ppool$, a distributed protocol executed by a set of $\totalParties$ parties
$\partyset$ which realizes $\Fpool$. A major consideration and performance
enhancement of our design is load balancing of transaction verification. Each
transaction is verified by a (deterministically elected) committee of parties,
whose size is a tradeoff between balancing workload, \ie not requiring each
party to verify every transaction, and reducing trust on the chosen
validator(s). We thus construct a distributed mempool, \ie a collectively
managed set of unpublished transactions, \st if a majority of the committee's
members are honest, transaction verification is secure.
