\paragraph{Related Work}
Despite the large number of available PoS cryptocurrencies, formal wallet
research has been rather sparse and limited so far. A widely implemented wallet
standard is the HD Wallet Standard BIP32~\cite{bip32}, based on the idea of
deterministic wallets~\cite{detwallet}. Gutoski and Stebila~\cite{FC:GutSte15}
studied security in the presence of partial key leakage, focusing on
BIP32-compliant wallets, whereas Courtois \etal~\cite{EPRINT:CouEmiVal14}
investigated the state of wallets and key management for
Bitcoin~\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. We note that these works focus on PoW-based
systems and thus do not consider issues such as stake delegation and protocol
participation. In the PoS setting, a related work is the Bitshares' delegation
PoS mechanism~\cite{schuh2017bitshares}, which, however, does not provide any
formal model or proof of security. Furthermore, a formal specification of
Cardano's wallet is also available~\cite{cardano-wallet}, although it focuses
on the wallet's implementation, rather than the security properties and
cryptographic model.
